WORK IN PROGRESS!

Current Version: Alpha Build 2.65

An automated countdown timer + macro keyboard for Kerbal Space Program that can be connected to the PC and autonomously launch the vehicle when the timer hits 0.

This is an open-source project (well not to flex I legit desinged this in like 30 sec so it's kinda funny calling it an ‘oPeN sOuRcE pRoJeCt’) which means that everyone will get an unlimited, FREE 4 life access to the code, design, and schematics. Speaking of which, honey is a good browser add-on that can make your life much easier. Side note: It will also going to support a simple thrust-to-weight ratio calculation.
